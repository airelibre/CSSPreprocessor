CSSPreprocessor
===============

A module that extends the stylesheets system of CMS Made Simple with various CSS Preprocessors.

Uses the standard Stylesheets / Design manager and caching system. Works with CMSMS 1.11.11 (until 1.3) and 2.1+ series. 

For the moment, only LESS preprocessors are provided (PHP and command-line), but you can extend it. Compiles Bootstrap 3.2 and further

A SASS preprocessor will be included soon.
