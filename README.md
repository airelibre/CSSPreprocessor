CSSPreprocessor
===============

A module that extends the stylesheets system of CMS Made Simple with various CSS Preprocessors.

Uses the standard Stylesheets / Design manager and caching system. Works with CMSMS 1.11.11 (until 1.3) and 2.1+ series.

For the moment, only LESS / SASS preprocessors are provided (PHP and command-line - if available on your server), but you can extend it. Compiles Bootstrap and Foundation.
Supports SMARTY inside stylesheets and before compilation.
