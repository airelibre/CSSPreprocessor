CSSPreprocessor
===============

A module that extends the stylesheets system of CMS Made Simple with various CSS Preprocessors.

Uses the standard Stylesheets / Design manager and caching system. Works with CMSMS 1.11.11 and upcoming 2.0+ series. 

For the moment, only LESS preprocessors are provided (PHP and command-line), but you can extend it. Compiles Bootstrap 3.2
