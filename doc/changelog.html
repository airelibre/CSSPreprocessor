            </li>
            <li>
                CMSMS 2.3 compatibility: works with DesignManager and file-based templates / stylesheets with the new {cms_queue_css} and {cms_render_css}
            </li>
            <li>
                Now includes https://github.com/padaliyajay/php-autoprefixer as a PHP Autoprefixer so it does not rely on PostCSS anymore
            </li>
            <li>
                Updated docs (translators please update your versions)

        <strong>3.0-beta1</strong> - 2017-06-19
        <ul>
            <li>Now works in CMSMS 2.2+ and uses the hooks system to process the entire SCSS/LESS code from various stylesheets directly in {cms_stylesheet}</li>
            <li>With the new CMSMS stylesheets hook you can now use many Sass/Less source CSS files in the Design manager (not limited to 1 anymore)</li>
            <li>Now using Autoprefixer with Postcss directly from CLI - you must install it on your server (see the CLI tool from https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) - Browsers list parameter removed</li>
            <li>The @@CSSPreprocessor@@ tag is no more needed: the entire concatenated stylesheet is now processed - if you don't need the CSSPreprocessor module, simply remove it or disable it.</li>
            <li>Removed the installer / uninstaller (nothing more to install and uninstall as there is no more event handler thanks to the hooks mechanism)</li>
            <li>Now clears the CMSMS cache when the module preferences are changed</li>
            <li>Bug fix wrt sourcemap files in Sass</li>
